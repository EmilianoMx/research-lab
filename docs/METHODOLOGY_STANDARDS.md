# Methodology Standards for Q1 Publications

## Introduction  
This document outlines the comprehensive standards for statistical methodology specifically tailored for Q1 publications. Adhering to these standards will enhance the quality and credibility of research outputs.

## 1. Research Design  
- **Clarity of Research Questions:** Clearly articulate the research questions or hypotheses.  
- **Appropriate Study Design:** Ensure the research design (e.g., experimental, observational) aligns with the research questions.  
  
## 2. Sample Size  
- **Calculation of Sample Size:** Perform a sample size calculation to ensure sufficient power to detect expected effects.  
- **Representativeness:** Ensure sample represents the target population to enhance generalizability.  
  
## 3. Data Collection  
- **Standardized Instruments:** Utilize validated instruments for data collection to minimize bias.  
- **Training of Data Collectors:** Ensure data collectors are adequately trained and monitored.  
  
## 4. Data Analysis  
- **Statistical Methods:** Use appropriate statistical methods based on data type and distribution.  
- **Software Transparency:** Report the software used for analyses, including version numbers.  

## 5. Reporting  
- **Transparent Reporting:** Follow reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, PRISMA, or STROBE depending on the study type.  
- **Effect Sizes:** Report effect sizes alongside statistical significance to provide a clearer understanding of clinical importance.

## 6. Ethical Considerations  
- **Approval and Consent:** Obtain necessary ethical approval and informed consent from participants.  
- **Transparency in Funding:** Disclose any funding sources or potential conflicts of interest.

## Conclusion  
Adhering to these methodology standards is crucial for enhancing the reproducibility and integrity of research published in Q1 journals. These guidelines serve as a minimum standard that researchers should strive for.
