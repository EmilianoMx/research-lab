# DATA MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

## FAIR Principles for Data Management

### Findable
1. Data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. This can be ensured through the use of persistent identifiers and metadata that describe the data set.
   - Use standardized identifiers (e.g., DOI, ORCID).
   - Ensure metadata is comprehensive and adheres to community standards.

### Accessible
2. Data should be accessible to users. This involves both physical and intellectual accessibility, ensuring users can obtain the data.
   - Data should be stored in a trustworthy repository.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to access the data.
   - Ensure that data can be accessed at no cost when possible, or provide clear licensing information.

### Interoperable
3. Data should be able to integrate and work with other datasets and tools. This includes using standard vocabularies and formats.
   - Use common data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
   - Utilize standardized languages and formats (e.g., RDF, XML).
   - Ensure the use of controlled vocabularies where applicable.

### Reusable
4. Data should be well-documented and of high quality to ensure it can be reused in the future. This includes having clear licensing and provenance.
   - Include detailed documentation describing the methodology and context.
   - Specify the conditions under which the data can be reused through clear licensing.

## Implementation Plan
- Assess existing datasets for compliance with FAIR principles.
- Develop training and resources for team members on FAIR principles.
- Regularly review and update data management protocols to ensure ongoing compliance with FAIR.

## Conclusion
By following the FAIR principles, we aim to improve the transparency and usability of our research data.
