# Contributing Guidelines for Computational Research

Thank you for considering contributing to our computational research project! This document outlines the guidelines and standards that contributors should follow to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Methodology Review
- **Open Science Principles**: Ensure that your methods adhere to open science principles. This includes sharing all methodologies, data, and materials.
- **Peer Review**: All new methodologies should be reviewed by at least one other contributor before being implemented in the project.

## Code Standards
- **Code Style**: Follow the project’s coding style guide. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and comment usage.
- **Documentation**: Write clear and concise documentation for all code. Use docstrings where applicable.
- **Version Control**: Commit code frequently with meaningful commit messages that explain the changes made.

## Data Management
- **File Organization**: Organize files in a logical directory structure. Use clear and descriptive names for data files.
- **Data Sharing**: Ensure that data used in the research is accessible to all contributors and adheres to ethical standards.
- **Data Formats**: Use standardized data formats to facilitate easy sharing and processing.

## Reproducibility Requirements
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that your code can be executed by others to reproduce your results. Include installation and setup instructions in your documentation.
- **Environment Specification**: Use environment files (e.g., requirements.txt, environment.yml) to specify dependencies and versions.

## Output Standards
- **Results Reporting**: Clearly report results with appropriate visualizations. Ensure that all figures and tables are well-labeled and documented.
- **Quality Control**: Implement quality control checks for outputs to catch potential issues early in the process.

## Publication Guidelines
- **Authorship**: Clearly define authorship roles and responsibilities at the outset of the project.
- **Citing Sources**: Acknowledge and cite all sources and methodologies used throughout the project.
- **Preprints and Publications**: Follow the designated process for submitting preprints and publications related to the research.

By following these guidelines, we can create a collaborative and productive environment for all contributors. Thank you for your contributions!
