# Governance Model

## Scope
This repository defines governance for policies and standards that guide scientific quality, reproducibility, and responsible data management in the Computational Research Lab.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Maintainer(s):** Own repository roadmap, approve strategic changes, and curate standards.
- **Contributors:** Propose updates through pull requests and follow project guidelines.
- **Reviewers:** Perform quality checks on methodological rigor, reproducibility, and clarity.

## Decision-Making
- Changes are proposed via pull requests.
- At least one review is required for policy changes.
- High-impact updates (e.g., governance, ethics, data policy) should include rationale and references.

## Quality Gate for Merges
A pull request should include:
1. Clear summary of changes and motivation.
2. Updated documentation where applicable.
3. Alignment with reproducibility and FAIR data principles.

## Versioning and Change Tracking
- Governance and standards are versioned through Git history.
- Significant policy updates should be reflected in release notes or PR descriptions.
